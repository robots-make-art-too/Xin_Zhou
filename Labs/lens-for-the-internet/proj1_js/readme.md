This is a timer whcih will fllow the 25 to 5's loop

"try me" is a short test, if you click "reapt",it will be a 0.1 mins timer

"Start" should be a 25 mins long timer, but I set it as a 0.3 mins to show how it works. 
When you click "back soon", it will change to a 0.2 minutes long timer which should be 5 mins actually.

If you miss the notification, the timer will stop and everything will reset until you click "try me" or "start".
