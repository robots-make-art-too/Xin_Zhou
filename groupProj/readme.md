6.I am confident about this course: 
    I am new on python, but I learn quickly!

7.Do I think this project will be: easy, as hard as I make it, difficult?
    I think it depends on our planning, could be easy or difficult. But I hope to get a good grade, so it might be hard.


8.Something about me:
    I learned a little C and C# before and I can make some simple games like Pacman and UI. My aesthetic is not very good, I think programming is easier for me than designing. But I am good at 3D modeling, I don't know if this will help with the group project.

9.I am prepared to come in-person or here are my questions and thoughts on the following:
    for lecture:
        If possible, could we please keep recording the lectures? The videoes help me a lot! So many words I haven't heard before, I often pause the video, do some research and then come back. 
    for labs(if online):
        I have lots of questions want to ask, they might be stupid, so I really wish we could have separate labs or we could line up to go into another zoom room to ask questions one by one. (a little bit shy........)

    Blender

16.Anything else:
    Honestly, my English is just so-so. So I may need make a summary even a list after each group meetings to reconfirm what we need to do. (may be a bit annoying, sorry to my group members.....)
