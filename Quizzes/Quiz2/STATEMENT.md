# Hi I am a statement

Tell me something here.

Three generations:
1 grandma
4 children and 1 child in law
4 grandchildren
Total 10 robots

But can add more

## I have a reason for being

What kind of flare did you use?

1. flash eyes
2. mouseclick can save image

## Original OOP
Three generations
grandma: wear grey cloth withou pattern
Gen 2:clothes with colors and patterns
Gen 3: clothes with colors and patterns, has flashing eyes
Name is on the bottom of each robot

## Anythin else ?
Two list file:
The order is from top generation to bottom
The unrelated bot is on the left of its spouse
So if follow this rule can add more in
headList is followed requiment, so my if and else statements are followed the headList. 
But it should be more freedom, I will try to fix latter
